# RJJ's dotfiles

Yet another repository for one's personal dotfiles. Here I'm keeping my own configurations and other settings which I use on different \*nix machines, so that they are kept centralized and easily accessible from everywhere.

### Installation

Just clone it to your `$HOME/`

```
git clone https://github.com/RJ-Jesus/dotfiles ~/
```

### Feedback

Feel free to make suggestions (as in, pull requests) to this setup or borrow ideas from it.
